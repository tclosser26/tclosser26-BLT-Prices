# predicted-blt-ingredient-prices-using-rstudio

In this project, I used Rstudio to make linear regression models of the predicted price of the ingredients of a BLT, that being bread, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes multiple years in the future. This data was displayed graphically with reactive elements like the predicted year and individually displayed variables being included and adjustable within the application, and simple descriptors and analysis adjusted to these reactive elements.
